# Reflow

Simple extensions to inject styles into raw HTML pages for better reading experience

## Concept

Inspired by the infamous [motherfuckingwebsite.com](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com) and [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com), Reflow is at its core a tool to stylize minimal, unstylized, basic HTML webpages into something typographically and visually acceptable and easily readable with an injected stylesheet.

## User Configurations

By default, Reflow applies a visual centering with side margins, font change to a sans serif typeface, increaes line heights and background colors. But further configurations are possible from the popup.

* Page width, between 40%, 50%, and 60%
* Font sizes
* Sepia, Night, and Daylight background themes for readability
* Typefaces between serif, sans-serif and monospace

## Installation

Installation is as any other Chrome / Chromium extension, by loading an unpacked directory into the developer extensions menu
